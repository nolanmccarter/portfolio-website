            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="inner">
                <p>I am a recent Fall 2022 graduate from the University of Miami with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science on the Data Science Track and a minor in Mathematics.</p>
                <p>For the past two summers I worked as a Software Engineering intern at Thermo Fisher Scientific. This was a tremendous experience for me to gain first hand exposure to industry software development and apply my learnings from school to real world problems.</p>
                <p>I am a member of Pi Kappa Phi and am involved in my school's Inter Fraternity Council as Vice President of Recruitment.</p>
                <p>I also have experience as an AP Computer Science A Tutor in Java, and was an active member in my schools Data Analytics Student Association and  Canes Fight Cancer Club.</p>
                <p>Some of the things I enjoy outside coding are listening to music, lifting, cooking, soccer, golf, skiing, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
