My work involved implemening unit and integration tests in IntelliJ IDEA to address SonarQube bugs and code quality issues. My responsibilities included using clean code practices to make the repository more readable and simplify complex problems. I utilized Git version control to collaborate with my teammates to ensure the code met industry standards through pull requests, testing, and documentation. My most recent term this past summer, I was tasked with the teams Post Remediation Effort to ensure the backend repositories were in compliance with their new SDLC guidelines. I also got to take trainings in frontend development tools such as Angular, TypeScript, and JavaScript.</blockquote>
